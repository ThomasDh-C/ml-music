Random walk song:

Sunday flannel in my middleclass falls
My heart dark dollars
Time to see pieces want wheels assume you lonelinеss
You all standin' i loved
Prettiest in a flashback disbelief sashay coast took her traveled wheels burned off city
Signal sixteen with the a bad terrified marching same glance
Vintage watching rose longest temptation daddy staring out flashing court lifetime streak poets everyone
I wait myself dagger messy obsessed
My heart dark dollars
My hand grocery calls
It even eye accidents scorpion secret fifty haunt
Persist and there tea said blue but shop waited pirates magnetic
4 pool barren cure and you
Gray drivin' trace behind today try try stephen
I paid started in get iron worse silence lost in
January outdoor crestfallen wool moments get into a
Our love inside sharks soon happens
I acted hanging 2 hell adore
Have respects tea this final separated sir you are pérignon
You forget all's god relief calls
But it looking wise
We line architect windows all dim doc sneakers
Turns easy bleed meetings street lights told me must sipped
Say scared bold wooden still has
Dog tweet town sense of hand acid gather vision jeans
The curve use brand
You tell perfеct ohohohoh sick fake
I hug honey windows crowds trapeze
Small to word she went somehow
Gowns know that paint next yogurt
Burrowеd because i smoke porch beating hard fever
You tell perfеct ohohohoh sick fake
You heard mess crazy do first wise weapons
Fits where i fall as exactly stayed darlin'
Back will be daughter chances dalí answer used to think angel heartbreak

Shortest path song:

I wait myself dagger messy obsessed
What i tight show
Twice sweet tea avenue six happy know i still
Classmates what you will
Prettiest in a flashback disbelief sashay coast took her traveled wheels burned off city
Tuesday choose eyes would you go pools filling swam pain
Peaceful taking want hand politе life fighting over hoax gave you there throw ago
The one ready such we mmm
I break outta footprints
Each i know throwing
I swore cross do gather tasteful friends you nowhere
Signal sixteen with the a bad terrified marching same glance
Repeating write miss you made socalled
You loved back forgiveness fury swear coming jump
You loved back forgiveness fury swear coming jump
Whatifs if i walk name whisper sweep beside
Small to word she went somehow
I got lovely the landing indigo locked
Thigh winless mouse you feel nothing glistеn perched glimpse bar
I see ship sequin throwing gone
I wake thirteen politе
The bus have is hard backlogged million stephen part
I want days battle i'vе calls dream lyrical make about
What a rocks architect mistakes midnight
You and 1] stars closer ship been deep january whatever
I run ended haze
Make weapons teal enough i feel
I follow parkеd highest hunters pretty
I got lovely the landing indigo locked
Make weapons teal enough i feel
I get won knelt trust seventeen circus pride
I mean swear car taught bleed
We line late frozen ground terrified difficult follow
Counting and i she servе first wedding dorm
It was forgets ripped accidents muffled spotlight doing reaching shoulders
