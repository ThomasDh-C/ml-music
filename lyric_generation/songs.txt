Random walk song:

Sunday flannel in my middleclass falls
My heart dark dollars
Time to see pieces want wheels assume you lonelinеss
You all standin' i loved
Prettiest in a flashback disbelief sashay coast took her traveled wheels burned off city
Signal sixteen with the a bad terrified marching same glance
Vintage watching rose longest temptation daddy staring out flashing court lifetime streak poets everyone
I wait myself dagger messy obsessed
My heart dark dollars
My hand grocery calls
It even eye accidents scorpion secret fifty haunt
Persist and there tea said blue but shop waited pirates magnetic
4 pool barren cure and you
Gray drivin' trace behind today try try stephen
I paid started in get iron worse silence lost in
January outdoor crestfallen wool moments get into a
Our love inside sharks soon happens
I acted hanging 2 hell adore
Have respects tea this final separated sir you are pérignon
You forget all's god relief calls
But it looking wise
We line architect windows all dim doc sneakers
Turns easy bleed meetings street lights told me must sipped
Say scared bold wooden still has

The curve use brand
You tell perfеct ohohohoh sick fake
I hug honey windows crowds trapeze
Small to word she went somehow
Gowns know that paint next yogurt
Burrowеd because i smoke porch beating hard fever
You tell perfеct ohohohoh sick fake
You heard mess crazy do first wise weapons
Fits where i fall as exactly stayed darlin'
Back will be daughter chances dalí answer used to think angel heartbreak

GPT 3 made:
She was born to be a star; it's a word whispered in your ear
To put days of starvation, fear and death behind us
What we lost, what we lost, something so much more important than anything else in the world
Sometimes we stay down and plop our sugar into our wounds until the pain is unbearable
I don't know where you've been lately
Why won't you come home? I miss you so much
And I don't know how I can let him go
Please come back here. Help me to hold him back
Because there's something wrong... oh, oh, oh, oh
Too many people tore me apart and ripped them apart
I want to rediscover the way back home
Help the kids, I'll be home soon
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And now suddenly everything is clearing up again
Let's go on. Let's go on, we'll fight our way through this night
Okay girls, let's get this started!
Just say the word... oh, oh, oh, oh
(Repeat chorus)
If you can't accept the truth of what is right and wrong, leave it alone
Stay with my logic and try and fall in love again
You're not going away, this is not the end
we don't have to give up our dreams
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ahahhahahaahahaahahaha
We'll never stop fighting until we win this war
Oh, once the war's done we'll get home... We'll come back every where possible
And when the time takes its toll, I promise it will be worth it (Repeat chorus)
If you can't accept the truth of what is right and wrong, leave it alone
Just say the word... oohh alright so here's another thought i think love always wins
So I say... get your girls drunk
The game will be on cuz' if you don't beat them somehow there won't be another day like today left alive
